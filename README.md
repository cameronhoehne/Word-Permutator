# Word-Permutator

This is an algorithmic web app that takes a user input of up to five words and outputs every unique combination of these words. The expected output is the factorial of the number of words provided, e.g. 4! (24 unique combinations).

A custom popup is displayed for errors, such as when there are duplicate words or more than five words provided.

This project helped deepen my knowledge of working with algorithms, the DOM, and how to display/remove certain information based on user input.
